    "For any project at scale, there is always a need to load data from files or various other sources into databases, which can be relational databases or big data storages like Hive or Impala. The reason for this is companies are becoming data centric and Data Professionals are at the centre of that. The Data needs to have all the 6 Vs value which can be harnessed by the organization. The 6 Vs are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Volume\n",
    "Volume, the first of the 5 V's of big data, refers to the amount of data that exists. Volume is like the base of big data, as it is the initial size and amount of data that is collected. If the volume of data is large enough, it can be considered big data. What is considered to be big data is relative, though, and will change depending on the available computing power that's on the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Velocity\n",
    "The next of the 5 V's of big data is velocity. It refers to how quickly data is generated and how quickly that data moves. This is an important aspect for companies need that need their data to flow quickly, so it's available at the right times to make the best business decisions possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "An organization that uses big data will have a large and continuous flow of data that is being created and sent to its end destination. Data could flow from sources such as machines, networks, smartphones or social media. This data needs to be digested and analyzed quickly, and sometimes in near real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, in healthcare, there are many medical devices made today to monitor patients and collect data. From in-hospital medical equipment to wearable devices, collected data needs to be sent to its destination and analyzed quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, however, it may be better to have a limited set of collected data than to collect more data than an organization can handle -- since this can lead to slower data velocities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variety\n",
    "The next V in the five 5 V's of big data is variety. Variety refers to the diversity of data types. An organization might obtain data from a number of different data sources, which may vary in value. Data can come from sources in and outside an enterprise as well. The challenge in variety concerns the standardization and distribution of all data being collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collected data can be unstructured, semi-structured or structured in nature. Unstructured data is data that is unorganized and comes in different files or formats. Typically, unstructured data is not a good fit for a mainstream relational database because it doesn't fit into conventional data models. Semi-structured data is data that has not been organized into a specialized repository but has associated information, such as metadata. This makes it easier to process than unstructured data. Structured data, meanwhile, is data that has been organized into a formatted repository. This means the data is made more addressable for effective data processing and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Veracity\n",
    "Veracity is the fourth V in the 5 V's of big data. It refers to the quality and accuracy of data. Gathered data could have missing pieces, may be inaccurate or may not be able to provide real, valuable insight. Veracity, overall, refers to the level of trust there is in the collected data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data can sometimes become messy and difficult to use. A large amount of data can cause more confusion than insights if it's incomplete. For example, concerning the medical field, if data about what drugs a patient is taking is incomplete, then the patient's life may be endangered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualize \n",
    "Visualize component leads to storyboarding and how beautifully the data can express a flow of patterns and trends which cannot be seen with naked eyes looking at numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Leading To\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Value\n",
    "The last V in the 6 V's of big data is value. This refers to the value that big data can provide, and it relates directly to what organizations can do with that collected data. Being able to pull value from big data is a requirement, as the value of big data increases significantly depending on the insights that can be gained from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Organizations can use the same big data tools to gather and analyze the data, but how they derive value from that data should be unique to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Python only works in-memory for a single node process. While distributed programming languages have tried to face this challenge, they are still generally in-memory and can never hope to process all of your data, and moving data is expensive. On top of all of this, data scientists must also find convenient ways to deploy their data and models. The whole process is time consuming. That is why we come up with efficient ways for Data Ingestion and performing manipulation and exploratory Analytics on it.\n",
